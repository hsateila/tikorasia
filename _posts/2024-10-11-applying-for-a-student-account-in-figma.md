# Creating a Figma Account and Applying for a Student License

As a student at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, you have access to Figma’s Education Plan, which includes all the tools and features of the regular Figma Professional Plan.

Here you can find [Figma’s official guide](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041061214-Verify-education-status) , which includes the criteria for the Education Plan that must be met. You will need your JAMK student email and a PDF-format enrollment or attendance certificate, which you can obtain from Peppi via the Atomi service.

## Steps to create the account and get Educational Plan

1.	Go to Figma’s website.
2.	In the top-left corner, select “Get started for free.”
3.	A modal will open where you need to enter your email and password. Use your JAMK student email, create a password for Figma, and create your account.
